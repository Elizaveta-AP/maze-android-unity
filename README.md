This is a logic game with labyrinths on the unity for android. Consists of a main menu and 32 levels of increasing difficulty. The levels are divided into 4 parts of 8 each and visually represent 4 seasons. To open a level, you must complete the previous one. To open the next season, you need to score a certain number of stars. Stars are given depending on the time it takes to complete each level. At the beginning of the level, time is given to study the zabyrinth and memorize the path. Then you are transported inside the labyrinth and control the character from a third person with a joystick. The first time you complete a level, you get 20 coins for each star, the second time you get 10. Coins can be spent on hints: look again at the labyrinth from above and at your current location.
